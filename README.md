What is This?
============

This is a spin-off of the project [Angel](https://github.com/jamwt/Angel/), which is centralized around managing
multiple processes, this will only wrap a single process in a unix environment,
And I plan to build loads of useful stuff into it : ).

Written with a defensive mindset using Haskell
